### See it in action

*  [List of live explorers running Iquidus](https://github.com/iquidus/explorer/wiki/Live-Explorers)


*Note: If you would like your instance mentioned here contact me*

### Requires

*  node.js >= 8.17.0 (12.14.0 is advised for updated dependencies)
*  mongodb 4.2.x
*  *coind

### Create database

Enter MongoDB cli:

    $ mongo

Create databse:

    > use explorerdb

Create user with read/write access:

    > db.createUser( { user: "iquidus", pwd: "3xp!0reR", roles: [ "readWrite" ] } )

*Note: If you're using mongo shell 4.2.x, use the following to create your user:

    > db.addUser( { user: "username", pwd: "password", roles: [ "readWrite"] })

### Get the source

    git clone https://github.com/iquidus/explorer explorer

### Install node modules

    cd explorer && npm install --production

### Configure

    cp ./settings.json.template ./settings.json

*Make required changes in settings.json*

### Start Explorer

    npm start

*Note: mongod must be running to start the explorer*

As of version 1.4.0 the explorer defaults to cluster mode, forking an instance of its process to each cpu core. This results in increased performance and stability. Load balancing gets automatically taken care of and any instances that for some reason die, will be restarted automatically. For testing/development (or if you just wish to) a single instance can be launched with

    node --stack-size=10000 bin/instance

To stop the cluster you can use

    npm stop

### Syncing databases with the blockchain

sync.js (located in scripts/) is used for updating the local databases. This script must be called from the explorers root directory.

    Usage: node scripts/sync.js [database] [mode]

    database: (required)
    index [mode] Main index: coin info/stats, transactions & addresses
    market       Market data: summaries, orderbooks, trade history & chartdata

    mode: (required for index database only)
    update       Updates index from last sync to current block
    check        checks index for (and adds) any missing transactions/addresses
    reindex      Clears index then resyncs from genesis to current block

    notes:
    * 'current block' is the latest created block when script is executed.
    * The market database only supports (& defaults to) reindex mode.
    * If check mode finds missing data(ignoring new data since last sync),
      index_timeout in settings.json is set too low.


*It is recommended to have this script launched via a cronjob at 1+ min intervals.*

**crontab**

*Example crontab; update index every minute and market data every 2 minutes*
